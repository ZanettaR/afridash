Code Rules:

1. 2 spaces – for indentation
2. Single quotes for strings – except to avoid escaping
3. No unused variables – this one catches tons of bugs!
4. No semicolons – It's fine. Really!
5. Never start a line with (, [, or `
This is the only gotcha with omitting semicolons – 
automatically checked for you!
6. Space after keywords if (condition) { ... }
7. Space after function name function name (arg) { ... }
8. Always use === instead of == – but obj == null is allowed 
to check null || undefined.
9. Always handle the node.js err function parameter
10. Variable and method names should be camelCase
11. Methods should be no more than 5 lines most allowed 8
12. If and else should have one line of code in them at most
 two
12 (II). he ternary operator can be used in most cases of 
simple if and else

Happy Coding :-)
